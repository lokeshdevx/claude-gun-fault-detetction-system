VISUAL DETECTION RULES — READ CAREFULLY
════════════════════════════════════════

── CORROSION ──
CRITICAL: Any brown, reddish-brown, orange-brown, rust-colored, or dark amber areas on the barrel interior ARE corrosion. This is rust forming on the metal surface.
- Look for: brown patches, rust stains, orange discoloration, reddish spots, dark brown blotches
- Even faint brown tinting counts as Low severity corrosion
- Widespread brown/rust coloration = High severity corrosion
- Do NOT confuse with lighting reflections (which appear as white/bright spots)
- Corrosion often appears as irregular patches rather than uniform coloration

── PITTING ──
- Look for: small dark holes, craters, or indentations in the barrel surface
- Pits appear as dark spots or puncture-like marks on the bore surface
- Can be isolated (Low) or clustered/widespread (High)
- Different from corrosion: pitting is physical surface damage (holes), corrosion is chemical surface discoloration

── BULGE ──
- Look for: outward swelling, deformation, or asymmetric barrel wall profile
- Appears as a visible bump or protrusion in the barrel wall
- The circular bore profile becomes irregular or distorted
- Check the roundness of the bore — any deviation from perfect circle may indicate bulge

── FLECKING OFF ──
- Look for: peeling, chipping, or detachment of the barrel's protective coating or lining
- Appears as flakes, chips, or patches where surface material is missing
- Exposed bare metal beneath the coating layer
- Different from pitting: flecking is surface coating loss, pitting is metal substrate damage

── SURFACE SPOTS ──
- Look for: localized abnormal dark, brown, black, orange, gray, or metallic spots
- May indicate early corrosion, oxidation, contamination, or residue buildup
- Different from pitting: spots are discolorations without obvious surface depressions

── CRACKS ──
- Look for: linear fractures, splits, or fissures in the barrel material
- Hairline cracks require reporting
- Different from scratches: cracks often have irregular edges and depth

── EROSION ──
- Look for: gradual surface wear, roughened texture, loss of original finish
- Most common near throat or chamber areas
- Severe erosion may affect rifling definition

── CARBON FOULING ──
- Look for: black or dark gray residue deposits
- Usually irregular patches following firing residue patterns
- Different from corrosion: carbon deposits sit on the surface without rust coloration

── CARBON DEPOSIT ──
- Look for: thick, hardened black or dark gray carbon buildup layered on the barrel surface
- Unlike Carbon Fouling (which is a residue film), Carbon Deposit is a dense, crusty, raised accumulation
- Often appears as raised ridges or solid patches rather than thin film
- Common near chamber throat; can affect bore dimensions if severe
- Distinguished from Carbon Fouling by its thickness and structural presence on the surface

── LEAD FOULING ──
- Look for: dull gray or silver deposits attached to the barrel surface
- Often appears smeared or layered

── RIFLING WEAR ──
- Look for: rounded, smoothed, or diminished rifling lands and grooves
- Reduced definition indicates wear

── SPOT ──
- Look for: a single well-defined circular or oval mark on the barrel surface
- Distinct from Surface Spots: a Spot is one isolated, clearly defined mark, not a cluster
- May appear as a dark, light, or discolored circle — caused by impact, contamination, or localized damage
- Check size carefully: a Spot is typically 1–10mm in diameter and has a clear boundary

── BARREL OBSTRUCTION ──
- Look for: foreign material partially or completely blocking the bore
- Includes debris, mud, cleaning patches, or lodged projectiles
- Any obstruction requires immediate attention

── RINGED BARREL ──
- Look for: circular internal swelling around barrel circumference
- Appears as a ring-like deformation inside the bore

── DENT ──
- Look for: localized inward deformation of the barrel wall
- Causes disruption of otherwise smooth internal contour

── SCRATCH / SCORING ──
- Look for: linear grooves, scratches, or scoring marks
- Usually run parallel with the bore axis

── CHROME LINING DAMAGE ──
- Look for: peeling, cracking, flaking, or uneven chrome coating
- Exposed substrate metal may be visible

── CHAMBER DAMAGE ──
- Look for: defects near the breech/chamber region
- Includes deformation, erosion, scratches, or cracking

LOCATION IDENTIFICATION

Estimate the approximate location of each issue as one of: "top-left", "top-right", "center", "bottom-left", "bottom-right".

════════════════════════════════════════
ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
════════════════════════════════════════
1. Examine the ENTIRE image systematically — top, bottom, left, right, center
2. Check color variations:
   - Brown/rust tones = Corrosion
   - Black/dark gray deposits = Carbon Fouling
   - Thick raised black/gray crust = Carbon Deposit
   - Gray/silver smearing = Lead Fouling
   - Localized dark spots without depression = Surface Spots or Spot (single mark)
3. Check surface texture:
   - Holes/craters = Pitting
   - Linear grooves = Scratch/Scoring
   - Rough degraded surface = Erosion
   - Single or multiple fractures = Cracks
4. Check profile and geometry:
   - Outward swelling = Bulge
   - Ring-like internal swelling = Ringed Barrel
   - Inward deformation = Dent
5. Check coating and lining:
   - Missing coating = Flecking Off
   - Chrome layer peeling = Chrome Lining Damage
6. Check specific zones:
   - Breech/chamber area = Chamber Damage
   - Bore opening = Barrel Obstruction
   - Rifling lands and grooves = Rifling Wear
7. A single image MAY have multiple defect types simultaneously — report ALL you detect
8. Be thorough — missing a defect is more dangerous than being slightly conservative
9. If you see brown/rust coloring anywhere, you MUST report Corrosion
